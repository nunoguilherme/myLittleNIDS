# 🕵️ myLittleNIDS 🕵️
myLittleNIDS is a simple Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) built using Python. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for monitoring network traffic and detecting potential security threats.

# 🔍 Features
Real-time monitoring: myLittleNIDS constantly monitors network traffic to detect suspicious activity and alert you to potential security threats.

Customizable rules: You can easily create and modify rules to match your specific security needs. These rules can be based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and other network attributes.

Easy-to-use interface: myLittleNIDS provides a simple command-line interface that lets you quickly start monitoring network traffic and view alerts.

# 🚀 Getting Started
